The College of St Flannan at Ennis is a new history of one of Ireland&#39;s most famous
schools. St Flannan&#39;s has been central to the life of Clare over many generations,
and it has given tens of thousands of students from all over Killaloe diocese and
beyond a thorough and worthwhile education, often in circumstances that were very
difficult; great numbers of its alumni have achieved distinction and celebrity in
various fields since the College was founded.
In its fifteen chapters and 48 pages of photographs, The College of St Flannan at
Ennis, gives us an enthralling account of the St Flannan&#39;s story, from its origins in
Famine-era Ireland, through the construction phase of the early 1880, the new era of
the Intermediate Certificate, and the years of the National Revival. The struggle for
national independence also features, largely through the personality of a famous
College President, Canon William O&#39;Kennedy. O&#39;Kennedy&#39;s successors are also
given detailed consideration; Canons Vaughan, Quinn and Maxwell, outstanding
figures all, who steered the College through the grimmest middle decades of the
twentieth century. Modern times begin with the serene figure of Canon John Cuddy
and the inspiration he afforded to his successors and his &#39;professors&#39;, especially the
lay staff on whom much of the teaching and administration now gradually devolved.
A fascinating read, this handsomely produced volume is available in hardcover
and paperback and is published by Maherantaska Books.
The College of St Flannan at Ennis will be launched on Tuesday 23 May 2023 at 8.
pm at Cois na hAbhna, Gort Road, Ennis.
